# File Analyzer

## Overview
The File Processor is a Java-based program that processes a given text file and provides useful information such as the total number of characters and words. Additionally, it lists the occurrences of each character and word, ordered from the most frequently used to the least frequently used. The program is case-insensitive and handles a variety of text input formats.

## Features
- **Total Character Count**: The program reports the total number of characters in the file.
- **Total Word Count**: The program calculates the total number of words in the file.
- **Character Occurrences**: It lists all characters in the file, sorted by frequency from most to least common.
- **Word Occurrences**: It lists all words in the file, sorted by frequency from most to least common.

## Example Program Output
-- File processor -- Enter the name of the file: asyoulik.txt Number of total characters: 1234 Number of total words: 1234 The list of characters: e -> 1234 a -> 1111 k -> 823 ... The list of words: a -> 1234 an -> 1111 much -> 823 ...
